# Spam Email Classifier

Spam Email Classifier is a project that utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm to accurately distinguish between spam and legitimate emails. This robust solution enhances user productivity and security by providing an effective tool for email filtering.

## Features

- Uses Naive Bayes algorithm for spam detection
- Enhances productivity and security by filtering emails
- Practical tool for distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails

## Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/spam-email-classifier.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab
   ```

Start the Jupyter Notebook server by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

This will open a new tab in your web browser showing the Jupyter Notebook dashboard. Navigate to the location of your `Naive Bayes Spam Classifier.ipynb` file and click on it to open it.

You can now run the code cells in the notebook by pressing Shift + Enter.

If you specifically want to run the code in the notebook using Python outside of Jupyter Notebook, you can convert the notebook to a Python script using the following command:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script Naive Bayes Spam Classifier.ipynb
```

This will create a `.py` file that you can then run using the `python` command. However, note that some functionalities of Jupyter Notebook, such as interactive widgets, may not work in a regular Python script.


3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python Naive Bayes Spam Classifier.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Use the Naive Bayes classifier to classify emails as spam or legitimate.
3. Enhance productivity and security by filtering emails effectively.
